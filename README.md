# Multi-Dimension Transformer
Multi-Dimensional Transformer architecture to perform time-series prediction for the remaining useful life of turbo fan engines based on the NASA C-MAPSS dataset.
Experiments were validated on all four engine types of the C-MAPPS benchmark dataset.

The code can be run by setting the desired engine type (eng_type = 'FD001') and executing the entire script.
